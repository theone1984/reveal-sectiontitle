## What does it do?

The plugin provides a way to automatically generate section title slides for reveal.js presentations.

## Documentation

The plugin is documented using its slideshow as a documentation.

## Start the slideshow

The SVG component depends on XML HTTP requests, so you need to start a webserver. One simple solution might be to start a simple Python server.

To do this, navigate to the folder where the code is located, and start the web server from there.

```
cd /folder/to/the/code
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8081
```

Then, navigate to "localhost:8081".
